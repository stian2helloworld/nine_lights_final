Elaboration more on stage 05:
Problems I envountered:
01. The system failed to filter the hands, especially when there were more than four hands inside the frame. The system had trouble distinguishing the main players
02. The hand key points varied according to hand size, which sometimes meant that people could not pass the design- this problem even existed now
